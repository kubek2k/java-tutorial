## Simple types

### Widening the type (class Widening)

  * make the code compile and do the same by changing the `printSum` signature
  
### Autoboxing 

  * make the code not to throw NPE by changing the signatures of `print` methods (but keeping the same number of them)
    
### Float comparison

  * by changing the compare method make the code return true (DELTA constant is a hint here ;) ).
  
## Arrays
  
### Printing arguments

  * make the class `PrintingArguments` `main` method print out passed arguments (IntelliJ should help with testing)
  
### Values swap

  * make the `ValuesSwap` class swap the elements of 2-elements array
    * as an extra exercise try not to us temporary value
    
### Spiral array

  * make the `spiralArray` produce spirally populated array
  
### FifthSmallest

  * make the `fifthSmallest` find the fifth smallest element of the array 
    * don't change the size of buffer
    * HINT: take a look at `Arrays#sort`
  
### EratosthenesSieve
  
  * with use of the arrays create an erathostenes sieve up to n
    * HINT: you can preallocate the temporary array with size n, and keep the primary numbers there 
        (as an extra exercise you can think about the tighter upper bound on n)
