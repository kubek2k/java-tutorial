### Iteration

  * Create a list out of array
  * Iterate over elements of list with use of index
  * Iterate over elements of list with use of while loop
  * Iterate over elements of list with use of for loop (implicit iterator)

### MyLinkedList

  * Make the class implement fully fledged linked list by implementing the `iterator` method (so that it iterates 
  over the integers contained in the list)
  
### Container

  * Make `main` print out `true false`, by fixing the A class
  
### ArrayFromList

  * Make the class compile by changing the way we get array from the list
  
### InTheMiddle
  
  * Find the position of the element in the middle of the list using `indexOf` and `lastIndexOf`
  
### ComparingLists
  
  * compare `LinkedList` and `ArrayList` in place of nulls and see which performs better in which circumstances
  
### Allmighty calculator

  * Continue with calculator, you can use any interfaces you like and change however you like. Try to encapsulate as much,
   as you can. You can add parentheses support.
